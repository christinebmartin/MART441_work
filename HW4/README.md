##Summary of Work Completed##
Added a Prompt for viewer to enter name.  Name and verbiage is added to body of html
Added a button, with a loop that references an array of names.  Array is displayed when button clicked
Created a button to refresh the page.  Button is shown with every If statements/results

###Steps Used To Complete Work###
Did NOT use my Rocketbook to design what needed to get done.  That probably explains why I struggled so much this week.
It wasn't the struggle of the concepts, but the struggle of the planning.
I had tried adding multiple images based on decisions made, but kept getting an error.  After giving up, sleeping on it,
I went back and found I didn't have the right punctuation at the end of a statement. DOH!
I reused the If functions from week 3, which didn't necessarily help wtih time, but kept my confusion to somewhat of a minimum

###Issues###
Still not confortable with If statements, but getting there. I think it's more the "else/if" that is getting me stumped.

I think it would help sort things out for me if I was able to draw the Else If statements and use the drawing to execute the code
