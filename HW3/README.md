##Summary of Work Completed##

###Steps Used To Complete Work###
SO MANY TO COUNT!!!!
I wanted to utilize the ternary operators for if/else, which proved to be very challenging.  I drew the statements decision tree
on my rocketbook, along with the required elements for the homework.

I spent a "crapton" of time reading about DOM, and functions.  Spent event more time playing on the Grasshopper app.


###Issues###
Everything about this week was an issue for me.
I'm still a bit fuzzy on the DOM and if I even did this correctly. We'll see though
I couldn't figure out how to hide the buttons when the if/else statements were complete.
Got SUPER turned around with where things were with the if/else and where to go next.  Started over and tried to methodically go through each one.
I tried using document.getElementById("dog1").style.display="none", but then it hit the button all the time
I wanted to the const dogFirst in the new verbiage of each new "adventure" but I couldn't figure out how to embed it within a response.  Tried using +, concat, (), but finally gave up because it was taking so long for something with little return on my time,
