# MART 441 Week 2 #
## Christine Martin ##

##Summary of Work Completed##
This week I spent quite a bit of time reading informaton about logging to the console.
Additionally I resurfaced something I attempted 3 years ago, adding sprite animation, to make the page a bit more interesting.

###Steps Used To Complete Work###
1.  Documented all required elements for the homework assignment in Rocketbook
2.  Practiced logging to the console and researching how to link to a URL from the console.
3.  Although the homeowrk indicated the background color should be in the header, I found it to be easier to include a CSS style sheet and link to that.

###Problems/Issues/Questions###
It's been 3 years since I took Creative Coding, so it's taken me a bit to refresh my skills on psj5.  The simple task of how to apply a background color at the header level to the entire document was something as simple as applying it to the "body", but it took some research on how to do that.

When creating the log for favorite websites I wanted the user to be able to click on the URL to open the page, however that only seems to work when the URLs are in the console.log element and not in a variable.

Since I resurrected this old project, I had to figure out how to animate the sprite sheet.  I wasn't able to do it in MART120 and abandonded it, but with a little bit of research and trial and error, I was able to get the animation of my walking man to work.
