Homework repository for MAR 441 Spring 2022

Base URL for site:

* Week 1 has been a bit of a struggle for me.  It's been 6 months since I completed 341, so it's been a bit of a challenge to get back into the swing of things.

* There was research that needed to be done on responsive pages as that wasn't discussed in previous classes.  This research impacted the design I originally had.
* I found  *[w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)* to be helpful in reaquanting myself with this assignment and refreshing my memory.  I also used the textbook HTML&CSS book extensively for this assginment.
* I always seem to get confused when setting up Atom and Github and making sure they sync properly.  After playing with that for awhile, deleting repositories and getting frustrated, I got it set up.

* Each assignment I use my Rocketbook to design what I want to build, making sure it fulfills the requirements for the week.

*I'm not super happy about the style of the page, but it was nice to get back into it.  I started, stopped, made it complicated, got stuck, and finally stepped back to make it what is needed to ease my way back into this class.
