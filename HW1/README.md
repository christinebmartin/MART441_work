Homework repository for MAR 441 Spring 2022

Base URL for site:

Week 1 has been a bit of a struggle for me.  It's been 6 months since I completed 341, so it's been a bit of a challenge to get back into the swing of things.

I always seem to get confused when setting up Atom and Github and making sure they sync properly.  After playing with that for awhile, deleting repositories and getting frustrated, I got it set up.

Each assignment I use my Rocketbook to design what I want to build, making sure it fulfills the requirements for the week.

I'm not super happy about the style of the page, but it was nice to get back into it.  I started, stopped, made it complicated, got stuck, and finally stepped back to make it what is needed to ease my way back into this class.
